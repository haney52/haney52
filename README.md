- 👋 Hi, I’m @haney52
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about coding and networking. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning information systems in college, and building my homelab. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, however I'm very new to all this, so probably not much help at the moment. 
- 📫 How to reach me michael.darryl.mc@gmail.com
